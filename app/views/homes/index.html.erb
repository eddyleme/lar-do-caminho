  <div class ="about_info">
    <p>LAR DO CAMINHO USA is a fully registered public charity located in Miami, and  incorporated in the state of Florida as an IRS recognized 501(c)(3) non-taxable entity. Our mission is to raise funds for Lar do Caminho, an orphanage founded in Brazil in 1974 for the benefit of children whose families are unable to provide adequate childcare. The children are entrusted to the organization by court order. They are given not just shelter and basic needs, but are ensured a broad education, emphasizing character-building. We invest in the children’s potential by helping them to recover their self-esteem.
    Lar do Caminho promotes the overall development of children at risk, throughout their formative years, and assures that they become fully and positively integrated into society.</p>
